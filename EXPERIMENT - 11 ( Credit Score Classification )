Write a program for the task of Credit Score Classification.

PROGRAM :-

import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score

# Sample credit score data (features and labels)
# Replace this with your own dataset
X = np.array([[25, 50000], [30, 80000], [35, 75000], [22, 30000], [40, 100000], [28, 60000]])
y = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0])  # 0 represents bad credit, 1 represents good credit

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a decision tree classifier
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()

# Train the classifier on the training data
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the testing data
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
classification_rep = classification_report(y_test, y_pred, target_names=['Bad Credit', 'Good Credit'])

# Print the results
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("Classification Report:")
print(classification_rep)
